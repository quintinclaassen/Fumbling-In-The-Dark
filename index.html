			<h1>The Lottery Exposition</h1>
			<img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.politicalanalysis.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Powerball_logo.jpg">
		</div>

		<h3>The rules:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>R1000 in virtual money invested through a trading account held with Easy Equities (so chosen because they offer fractional share holdings and the lowest trading costs out of South African trading platforms).</li>
			<li>The <a href="https://www.nationallottery.co.za/about/how-to-powerball">Powerball game</a> is a draw of five balls <em>without replacement</em> from an urn of fifty. Additionally, a sixth <em>powerball</em> is drawn from a seperate urn of twenty. I assign the number of each ball to the JSE-listed company with that particular market capitalisation weighting rank on the exchange (as at that Friday's close).</li>
			<li>The Powerball draw takes place twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday evenings. I will only be looking at Friday draws. The portfolio will be rebalanced weekly on Mondays, based on the previous Friday's draw, at as close to opening prices as possible.</li>
			<li>One sixth of the portfolio's capital will be invested in each stock which was drawn. Since there is the potential for repetition of numbers (the <em>powerball</em> could be the same number as one drawn in the initial five-ball draw), there is the potential to be double-weighted in a Top-20 stock.</li>
			<li>Stocks already held in the portfolio and again drawn on the Friday evening will be rebalanced to one sixth (or two sixths if drawn twice) of the portfolio on Monday morning.</li>			
		</ul>

		<h3>Potential issues:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Biggest concern is exorbitant trading costs from weekly rebalancing. But I want the excitement of rebalancing based on completely random weekly Lottery numbers, so I'm fine to stomach this until the portfolio goes bust.</li>
			<li>A bias in the portfolio holdings toward Top-20 stocks because of the potential for double-weightings from the <em>powerball</em>.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A bad start to the experiment, with all of our week 1 stocks down after costs. Mr Price the biggest loser, down 6%, but not too many surprises there.</p>

		<p>Our week 2 serving is a mixed bag. Exxaro has recently been served with 'letters calling force majeure on the coal supply agreements in place for the supply of coal to the Medupi and Matimba power stations. As indicated in the letters received, this will be applicable for the period starting at 16 April 2020 until one month after national lockdown has been completely lifted.', but they're sure to fight in court (EXX closed 7% down on the day of the announcement).</p>

		<p>We are now also part of the club of Spar holders, behind the PIC (17%) and Coronation (who recently increased their stake to 15%). Pepkor have warned that the lag in their supply chain means the Covid-19 effects will likely only be felt in the second half of the year. Firstrand is down more than 35% year to date, but has still 'outperformed' the other Big 3.</p>

		<h3>Draw 1: 24 April</h3>	
		<img src="24_04_2020.png" align="right">
		<p>
			And we're off with the first draw. The two most interesting picks Powerball has served up us are perhaps Mr Price and Growthpoint, which would seem strange longs going into the final week of South Africa's Phase 5 lockdown. But, we remain hopeful that the extra spectrum granted to the telcos will give Vodacom a boost and the inevitable demand for more liquidity will boost Capitec's short term lending. 
		</p>

		<p>
			However things don't look too promising: of the five, Capitec, Bidcorp, Mr Price and Growthpoint are all down about 30% over the past three months, with Vodacom fairly flat and Anglo the only stock clear in the green up around 75%.

		<h3>Portfolio build: 28 April*</h3>	

		<p>
			Most of our stocks opened stronger today, so our entry levels were higher than expected. See the images below for a full cost breakdown. It seems as though property shares are exempt from Securities Transfer Tax, though I'm not sure why. It may be something to do with REITS?
