		As an exercise in observing the potential for randomness in investment returns, I have formulated a weekly trading strategy based on The South African National Lottery, particularly Powerball.

		<h3>The rules:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>R1000 in virtual money invested through a trading account held with Easy Equities (so chosen because they offer fractional share holdings and the lowest trading costs out of South African trading platforms).</li>
			<li>The <a href="https://www.nationallottery.co.za/about/how-to-powerball">Powerball game</a> is a draw of five balls <em>without replacement</em> from an urn of fifty. Additionally, a sixth <em>powerball</em> is drawn from a seperate urn of twenty. I assign the number of each ball to the JSE-listed company with that particular market capitalisation weighting rank on the exchange (as at that Friday's close).</li>
			<li>The Powerball draw takes place twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday evenings. I will only be looking at Friday draws. The portfolio will be rebalanced weekly on Mondays, based on the previous Friday's draw, at as close to opening prices as possible.</li>
			<li>One sixth of the portfolio's capital will be invested in each stock which was drawn. Since there is the potential for repetition of numbers (the <em>powerball</em> could be the same number as one drawn in the initial five-ball draw), there is the potential to be double-weighted in a Top-20 stock.</li>
			<li>Stocks already held in the portfolio and again drawn on the Friday evening will be rebalanced to one sixth (or two sixths if drawn twice) of the portfolio on Monday morning.</li>			
		</ul>

		<h3>Potential issues:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Biggest concern is exorbitant trading costs from weekly rebalancing. But I want the excitement of rebalancing based on completely random weekly Lottery numbers, so I'm fine to stomach this until the portfolio goes bust.</li>
			<li>A bias in the portfolio holdings toward Top-20 stocks because of the potential for double-weightings from the <em>powerball</em>.</li>
		</ul>

		Why Powerball? The jackpot currently sits at R123m, so I figure it's the draw most people will be interested in.
